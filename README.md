# gdal-ecw
GDAL compilation with ECW - Just for reporting issues to GDAL developers

```
https://github.com/jorgejesus/gdal-ecw
cd gdal-ecw
docker build -t gdal .
```

The compilation breaks with function signature problems

Docker will download the SDK from a temporary link (link value for 3 months and only for purpose of debuggin)
